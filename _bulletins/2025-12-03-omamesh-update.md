🌐 Meshtastic Still Going Strong — But Many Are Trying MeshCore

Meshtastic continues to be alive and well doing exactly what it was built for, and plenty of folks are still happily using it, including myself.

However, a growing number of users — including some with access to professional tower sites and commercial-grade gear — have started switching to MeshCore because it tends to deliver more reliable messaging (especially with acknowledgements and multi-hop routes).

If you’d like to give MeshCore a try, feel free to:

- Post in Public Chat.
- Or send a message to any Room Server you discover on the air.
- Or just DM another user — most people don’t mind, and you’ll often get a delivery ACK.

🤖 A Note on the MeshBot Experiments

I’ve been experimenting with a small MeshBot running on the mesh. It can:

- Respond to ping.
- Give a Magic 8 Ball answer.
- Show a list of known stations it has recently heard.
- …and more fun things as the project evolves.

Feel free to interact with it if you see it online.

📡 Recommended Radio Settings (OmaMesh Defaults)

Through local testing, the Omaha-area group has found that SF9 works noticeably better than the default SF7 for most terrain and building environments.

If you’d like to match the local settings:

- In Radio Settings, pick: USA/Canada (Recommended) preset.
- Change Spreading Factor to 9.
- If you're running a repeater, also set: Coding Rate = 8.
- Save settings and reboot your device.

These adjustments have significantly improved consistency across the metro.

📶 Real-World Distances Observed

The mesh has been holding up extremely well lately:

- Some users have logged nearly 60 miles of reliable message paths.
- There’s a verified 33-mile hop from Council Bluffs, IA → Mead, NE.
- Interactive back-and-forth conversations between downtown Omaha ↔ Elkhorn are now common, often with positive ACKs.
- Yes — we even have a #tictactoe hashtag channel for playing the game entirely over RF.

🌐 Website Updates

More info will be coming to the site soon, but for now please check OmaMesh.net occasionally for updates. It’s a bit sparse at the moment, but that will improve over time.

Hope to see you on the air!
