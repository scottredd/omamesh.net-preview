## About OmaMesh

**OmaMesh** is a community-driven mesh radio network serving the Omaha metro area and beyond. It’s built by local enthusiasts who believe communication should be **resilient, open, and fun to experiment with**—whether the internet is up, down, or nowhere nearby.

At its core, OmaMesh is about people. We’re hikers, cyclists, tinkerers, emergency-preparedness nerds, and curious neighbors who enjoy learning how radios work and what’s possible when devices cooperate instead of relying on centralized infrastructure.

## What We’re Building

OmaMesh focuses on low-power, long-range radios that form self-healing networks. Nodes automatically relay messages for one another, allowing communication across neighborhoods, trails, and rural areas—even when cell service isn’t available.

We primarily work with two open platforms:

- **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}** – A widely used open-source firmware and ecosystem for LoRa-based text messaging, GPS sharing, and telemetry.
- **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** – A newer, lightweight mesh protocol optimized for experimentation, automation, and creative integrations.

OmaMesh supports **both**, and many of our nodes bridge ideas, tools, and lessons learned between them.

## Why a Mesh?

Mesh networks shine when traditional networks struggle:

- 📡 **No infrastructure required** – Nodes talk directly to each other  
- 🔁 **Self-healing paths** – Messages route around failures  
- 🔋 **Low power** – Many devices run for days or weeks on batteries  
- 🌲 **Perfect for outdoors** – Trails, camping, cycling, and events  
- 🧠 **Great for learning** – RF, networking, and distributed systems  

Some members are interested in emergency communications. Others just want to send messages from a bike ride, log weather data, or see how far a signal can travel from a hilltop repeater.

All of that is welcome here.

## A Local Network with an Open Spirit

OmaMesh is intentionally informal and experimental. There’s no “right” way to participate:

- Run a home node or rooftop repeater  
- Carry a mobile node while biking or hiking  
- Build bots, dashboards, or maps  
- Experiment with antennas and placements  
- Just listen and learn  

We share configuration tips, compare notes, and document what works (and what doesn’t) in eastern Nebraska’s terrain.
